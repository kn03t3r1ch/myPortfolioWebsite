#### Portfolio Website

## 22.02
* decided to do the portfolio website with react and sanity.io because I found a tutorial that builds a portfolio website from scratch with these frameworks
* had a lot of issues to even get it starting. npm audit said that there where a total of 24 vulnerabilities some of them low some of them middle and some of them high
* after trying to understand what all those vulnerabilities mean I reinstalled npm and created the whole project again and now I am only having this one error "tsutils@3.20.0 requires a peer of typescript@>=2.8.0" and some optional and I cant find anything about how to be able to fix them on google!!! I decided to ignore and move on <br/> hopefully this is not to important ^^
